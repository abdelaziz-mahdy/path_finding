# Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
Welcome to the Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer, a Flutter application that demonstrates the mechanics of popular pathfinding algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's. This tool is designed to help users visualize how these algorithms traverse a grid to determine the shortest path.

## Features
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Experience A* and Dijkstra's algorithm in a dynamic, easy-to-understand format.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Design Patterns**: Built using efficient and maintainable coding practices and design patterns.
